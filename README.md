# HRI Tactile Project

## Overview
A research internship at [Institute for Cognitive Systems](https://www.ics.ei.tum.de/en/home/) in TU Munich. With supervisor [Mohsen Kaboli](https://www.ics.ei.tum.de/en/people/kaboli/). Base on NAO and artificial skin.

- Discretize the state space of joints and use Q-network to train the robot to do some manipulations
- NAO_scripts contain the python files for ROS working on real robot
- Simulation_scripts contain python files for Vrep simulation. You have to install choregraph as well, and use choregraphe to connect the robot, then you can still use rospy API and NAOqi to control the robot.
