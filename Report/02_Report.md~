### What I have done?
- define the state space and reward function
- set up a *Q-network* struture for reinforcement learning
- roughly train the robot to draw a straight line, be still not convergent

### Problem:
- reward is not precise, not exact postive correlation to the deviations
- action move and train process still in discretization, not continuously
- poor accuracy in motor

### Next plan:
- train the robot in simulation RVIZ at first
- make the training process more smooth, continuously, not step by step
- try to draw more complex stuff and letter?
